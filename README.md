Ring It Up
==========

This is code for the 2012–13 FIRST™ Tech Challenge game, Ring It Up!
In the directory /Autonomous Matrix, you'll find code for all of our autonomouses.  IRautonomous2.c was our primary autonomous.
In the directory /Flethcer, you will find TeleOp code.  TeleopHR.c was our primary TeleOp.


NOTES
=====

- Not all the code was meant to do anything. The files that didn't do anything include:
 - nada.c
 - Holonomic_TeleOp.c
 - TurnCalib.c
 - DistCalib.c
 - get_to_ring_dispenser.c
- Some files were meant to do something, but were never used in the season, such as these:
 - Drive_to_dispenser_interface.h
- Some files were used for a time, but later got replaced and thus made obsolete:
 - IRAutonomous.c
 - get_in_the_wayL.c
 - get_in_the_wayR.c
